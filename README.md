## Description
- Our project is about creating a web app to help people with mental health. It includes features such as a journal in which people can express themselves, a well-being tracker, and motivational content. The web app also contains Side Quests where users can connect/interact with the community. For more experiences, the user can engage in mindfulness and meditation exercises.
